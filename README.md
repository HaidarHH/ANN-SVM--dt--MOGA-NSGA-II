# ANN-SVM--dt--MOGA-NSGA-II
Code in Python that you can use as a starting point to read a CSV file, preprocess the data, apply feature selection using SVM-ANOVA, and apply various machine learning models (ANN, SVM, and decision tree) to predict energy consumption and occupants' comfort. The code also includes code to optimize the hyperparameters of the machine learning models using grid search and to compare the performance of the models using R2, RMSE, MSE, and MAE. The code uses the best machine learning model (selected earlier) as the fitness function for MOGA and NSGA II and prints the Pareto front with the ideal point.
